# Getting Started

First clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tulXoro/coll-trie-site
```

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 12.22 or higher) installed and ensure you installed react/nextjs:

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment

This website is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs). We also use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for styling. Please read refer to the docs throughout development.

Note that because NextJS is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), so you may want to refer to their docs from time to time.
