# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. If there are errors, you may need to re-compile the website.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Environment

This website is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs). We also use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for styling. Please read refer to the docs throughout development.

Note that because NextJS is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), you may want to refer to their docs from time to time.
