## Environment

This website is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs). We also use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for styling. Please read refer to the docs throughout development.

Note that because NextJS is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), you may want to refer to their docs from time to time.
